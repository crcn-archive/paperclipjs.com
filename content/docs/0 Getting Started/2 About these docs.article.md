These docs are here to guide you through building a scalable Mojo application. Some of the examples used
are intentionally inconsistent since there is no real right or wrong way to build mojo applications. There
are many different styles, pick whatever flavor suites your needs.

A lot of the concepts, and examples used in these docs are designed through trail-and-error developing applications at [ClassDojo](http://classdojo.com), and other projects. Everything from architecture, API's, practices, to testing, have all been optimized for developer workflow. We hope that you find these docs useful when developing Mojo based, and even non-Mojo based applications.

The examples provided in these docs are fully editable, and runnable. The examples also automatically resolve any NPM modules using [browserify CDN](http://wzrd.in/), so you can load any remote NPM repository you want.
