MojoJS is a customizable JavaScript framework inspired by NodeJS, BackboneJS, and many other JavaScript, and non-JavaScript frameworks. 

MojoJS was designed with the [Strangler Pattern](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html) in mind. If you already have a pre-existing application, you can easily build Mojo on-top of it without a full application re-write. This means you can slowly ease into it without worrying about the all-or-nothing approach associated with most JavaScript frameworks.

Mojo's level of abstraction also makes it very easy to re-purpose the framework to do whatever you want. You can
use Mojo on the backend without the additional baggage of having other platform-specific modules, such as the HTTP router.
