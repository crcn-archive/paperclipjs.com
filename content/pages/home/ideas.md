### What mojo is

### What's important
  - speed
    - graph showing different frameworks
  - testability
    - modularity = testability
    - test in node
  - Simple
    - designed to please the eye. We want you to write beautiful, well architected code.
    - easy to understand
    - very explicit - no unexpected, magic behavior
    - work directly with browser API's, no needless abstractions. Metamorph tags, shadow dom, etc, dirty type checking.
    - strong encapsulation - focus on the views, just the views. add stuff later
      - easy to create API without a backend
      - makes testing easier
  - Flexible
    - works with any framework
    - works with your existing stack, not replace it
  - platform support
    - mobile support
    - phonegap
    - node.js
  - features (with comparisons)
    - routing
    - explicit data-binding
    - models
    - totally customizable
    - plugin-based
    - 

- just the views, just the models, just the router. Use whatever you want
to build your application

- encapsulated, loosely coupled - no library depends on one another

- completely customizable javascript framework

- A javascript framework that allows you to use ____ with ____.
- talk about development speed
- talk about features & benefits
  - Mix and match any library you want
  - build sophisticated, yet simple applications at a fraction of the time & cost*
  - Explicit, cohesive
  - written with process in mind

- elegance

- 
- easy interpolation between any library
  - react, backbone, mojo

### Key benefits

- No lock-in
  - no magic
- modeled after backbone
- very fast
- modular
- broad usage


### What are people going to use it for?

- mobile development
- server-side development
  - fast
  - 

- Simple - Love Backbone.js? You'll appreciate mojo's straight-forward API. Nothing fancy about it. 

- Interoperable - Mojo was engineered to work with other libraries. Work with angular, react, backbone, 
whatever you want. Check out the available [cross-framework plugins](LINK)

- Modular - Mojo isn't just one library, it's many loosely coupled, and highly extendable libraries. Pick whatever you want to suite your application needs.

- Fast -  Mojo works very well with old browsers (IE 7+), along with newer browsers. Check out the benchmarks.

- Isomorphic - Run code on the server, and in the browser. 

- Extensible - Mojo is plugin-based at its core. Easily use whatever library 

- Testable - very fast, and very easy. You can even run tests in Node.js.

- Scalable - The design patterns in Mojo 

- Explicit - 

built with the Node.js 
- scalable - architecture
- simple - straight forward, do-less API. 
- isomorphic - Run code anywhere - seriously. Mojo was built to run 
- Extendable - customize the framework based on your needs
