PaperclipJS is a tiny immutable virtual dom library for building user interfaces. It compiles HTML straight to JavaScript, and only updates the parts it needs to. This means you get Ã¼ber fast apps with a low CPU & memory footprint.

Paperclip was designed for interoperability, and customization. Incorporate it into your existing application, or use it with any rendering engine (DOM, Canvas, WebGL, server-side).

<!--
## Any rendering engine

Paperclip works with any rendering engine. Easily build sophisticated user interfaces that interoperate between DOM, WebGL, Canvas, SVG, and more. Here's a simple [pixi.js demo](https://github.com/mojo-js/paperclip.js/tree/master/examples/common/documents/pixi):

index.js:

```javascript

```

template.pc:

```html
How many bunnies? <input type="text" value={{<~>numBunnies}}></input>

<pixi>
    <repeat each={{range(numBunnies)}} as='bunny'>
    </repeat>
</pixi>
```
